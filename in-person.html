        <h2> Introduction </h2>
    
            <p> In a survey that was conducted by the US research institute Gensler Research Institute, around 
                90% of employees prefer to go back to work in an office environment. Employees who work in 
                offices need to have different skills such as the ability to exchange opinions, face to face 
                communication, and work as a team. Working from home can lead to stress as the cohabiting 
                and working places are similar. Although remote work has been dominantly applied starting from 
                the pandemic time, many professionals are looking forward to returning to their office environment, as 
                they miss working together with other colleagues, sharing their daily life, and getting inspired 
                in spaces specially designed to stimulate their creativity. 
            </p>
    
        <h2> Pros of In-person work environment </h2>
            
            <ol>
                
                <li> Conduct face to face meetings </li>
    
                    <p> 
                        It is very essential for certain projects or works to conduct face-to-face meetings. Arranging 
                        personal meetings with our important clients can help us to easily market our ideas or proposals 
                        as our clients will have a sense of engagement and being part of the process. Face-to-face 
                        meetings also help our clients to see how we perform safely and naturally in a professional manner. 
                    </p>
    
    
                <li> Better distribution of workspace</li> 
    
                    <p> 
                        On certain occasions, office work includes doing tasks in a highly optimized and functional workspace. 
                        This type of workspace is interesting as it allows the free circulation of employees in a fluid 
                        manner. In this way, it is easier to improve and increase the interaction of workers. Additionally, it 
                        also makes workers active on their duty as they will not be sitting on a chair for long hours like 
                        in remote work areas. 
                    </p>
    
                </li>
    
            </ol>
    
            
        <h2> Cons of In-person work environment </h2>
    
            <ol>
    
                <li> Lack of Privacy </li>
    
                    <p> 
                        Introverted people may not like working in an office environment as a team. This is going to be a great
                        disadvantage if we work in open spaces and offices, as many introverted employees can end up feeling
                        uncomfortable. As a result of this, the overall productivity of the team is more likely to be below
                        the expected value. 
                    </p>
    
                <li> Increased stress and/or anxiety</li>
                    
                    <p> 
                        An employee is more likely to feel under pressure when working in an office environment either by our 
                        managers or other colleagues. This is going to result in lower productivity and capacity to work as it 
                        causes stress on the worker. They might result in rapid burnout of employees if not managed properly. 
                    </p>
